I hope to demonstrate how relations can be represented in idiomatic Go, and that using relational algebra doesn't mean using an SQL server and a query language.  It can be simple and high performance, and can handle the continuous queries that traditional RDBMS solutions can't handle.  I also hope to give a new perspective on existing Go code.

Maybe you're not the kind of person who needs to know how things work, but if you have your eyeballs on this page, I'm betting you are.  And people like us tinker--that's how we find things out.  For me, following the trail from pizza to brioche just shows the lay of the land.  Seeing how everything is connected rather than just following directions makes me a better cook.
