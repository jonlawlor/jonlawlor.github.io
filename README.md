My Blog about Relational Datastreams in Go

The code here is experimental and is meant to be adapted for your specific uses.  Feel free to use it as you wish.  The point of the blog is to explore the different ways to construct datastream stages in (idiomatic) Go, and examine their strengths, weaknesses, and performance.  You'll find the benchmarks in the (relpipes)[github.com/jonlawlor/relpipes] package.

I've implemented an entire relational algebra already in the (rel)[github.com/jonlawlor/rel] package, using a stupendous amount of reflection.  This blog is intended to take a more granular, understandable, and idiomatic approach.  I am learning some things as I go, but I'm going to benchmark performance as best as I can, and solicit better implementations as best I can.  I'll try to keep the implementations here up to date, and integrate that help.
